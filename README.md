# Project: Introduction to Object Handling in JavaScript for Beginner's Developers

## Description


This is a simple project create as the objective provide a pratrice introduction to object handling in JavaScript. The project uses an object list to represent personal information, such as name, age, and city, for different individuals.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of an HTML file that incorporates an embedded JavaScript script. This script contains a list of objects to represent people, each with specific properties.

    <script>

      // List of people to understand object handling
        var people = [{
            'name' : 'Lukka',
            'age' : '19',
            'city' : 'Osasco',
        },
        {
            'name' : 'Paola',
            'age' : '22',
            'city' : 'Rio de Janeiro'
        },
        {
            'name' : 'Brenda',
            'age' : '22',
            'city' : 'Berlin',
        }
        ]

        // Example of data access for educational purposes
        alert(people[1].name)

    </script>

## Why Use Objects in JavaScript?

Objects in JavaScript are fundamental for organizing and structuring data efficiently. Here are some reasons why objects are so useful, especially for beginner developers:

- Structured Organization: Objects allow you to organize related data in a cohesive structure, facilitating code understanding and maintenance.

- Ease of Access: By using objects, it's possible to access specific data in a clear and direct way, as exemplified in the project. This simplifies data manipulation and reading.

- Code Reusability: Once you create an object, you can reuse it in different parts of your code. This promotes reusability and avoids unnecessary repetition.

- Object-Oriented Language: JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, and understanding object handling is essential to develop advanced skills in the language.

This project is an excellent opportunity for beginners to learn hands-on how objects in JavaScript can be used to organize and manipulate data effectively. Feel free to explore, experiment, and expand this project as you progress in your learning journey! ðŸš€âœ¨
